hello! welcome to my script setup! a compilation of scripts by me: @ducko#0415.

most of the scripts in this pack are made by other people, DM the people in the credits above the scripts for bug reports, support, etc. not me please.

if you have any suggestions, questions, issues with the script setup, dm me on discord.

suggestion/directions to install: extract the zip folder (with WinRAR) and copy the scripts inside then go to the scripts folder of your exploit and paste them there, now you are op script kiddie.
