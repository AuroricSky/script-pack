hello! welcome to my script pack! a compilation of scripts by me: @duck0#0001.  
all the scripts in this pack are made by other people, DM the people listed in credits for bug reports, support, etc. not me please.
if you have any suggestions, questions, issues for/about/with the script pack, dm me on discord @duck0#0001.
suggestion: extract the zip folder and copy the scripts inside then go to the scripts folder of your exploit and paste them there, now you are op script kiddie.
Enjoy!
**UPDATED 7/10/20**
be sure to check back at the scripts channel every week (7 days) in the morning (EDT) for a new update. or 1 to 6 days if i feel like it when im really bored.
100+ scripts!
txt files are not supposed to be executed.
always DM me unworking/patched scripts!
credits: 
credits are found in each individual script along with the source (and the update log when they get added as well), if a script has neither of those, it means its an old script i added when i never used to do credits. if you script devs want them added, dm me.
also if any of you script devs want a script removed dm me, or if the proper credits are needed send me a list of them. also dm me if you want your credits updated cus i won't notice them unless i do.
i hope you enjoy my script pack!
